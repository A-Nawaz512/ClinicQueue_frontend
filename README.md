🏥 Clinic Queue Management System

A real-world clinic queue management system designed to improve patient flow, reduce waiting confusion, and help clinic staff manage visits efficiently through a clean dashboard.

Clean, responsive dashboard UI

Designed for fast-paced clinical environments

🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions

React.js + Vite – fast development & optimized builds

Tailwind CSS – scalable, utility-first UI styling

Redux Toolkit – predictable and maintainable state management

Node.js + Express.js – REST-based backend architecture
